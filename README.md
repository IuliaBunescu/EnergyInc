# EnergyInc Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

EnergyInc, a leading utility company in Europe, is facing an increasing customer churn rate, especially in its SME division. This project aims to identify the factors driving customer defections and develop a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churning. The primary objective is to assist EnergyInc in implementing preemptive measures to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention.

## Objective

- Analyze the provided dataset to understand the factors influencing customer churn.
- Develop a predictive model to identify customers with a high propensity to churn.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of offering a 20% discount to high-risk customers as a preemptive measure.

## Data

- **Training Data**: Features of SME customers from January 2016 and their churn status by March 2016, along with pricing information from 2015.
- **Test Data**: A separate dataset of SME customers to score and classify based on churn propensity.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Utilize descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
    - Identify patterns, correlations, and potential drivers of churn.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Select relevant features that can significantly impact churn prediction.
    - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables appropriately.

3. **Model Selection**:
    - Test multiple algorithms to identify the most suitable model.
    - Describe the tested algorithms and their performance metrics.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Train the selected model on the training dataset.
    - Evaluate the model using ROC curve and Brier score.

5. **Prediction and Classification**:
    - Score the customers in the test dataset based on churn propensity.
    - Classify customers into two categories: "1" for high-risk of churn and "0" for low-risk.

## Commercial Actions

- Recommend offering a 20% discount to customers predicted to churn.
- Assess the financial implications of the discount offer on revenues.

## Deliverables

1. **Predictive Model**: Trained model to predict customer churn.
2. **Result Template**: Scoring and classification of customers in the test dataset.
3. **Presentation**: Detailed findings, insights, and recommendations for EnergyInc.
    - Include ROC curve and Brier score of the model.
  
## Conclusion

This project aims to address the customer churn issue faced by EnergyInc by leveraging predictive modeling and data-driven insights. By identifying high-risk customers and implementing targeted preemptive measures, EnergyInc can enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates effectively.

**Note**: The project will also evaluate the feasibility and impact of offering a 20% discount to high-risk customers as a strategic measure to mitigate churn.
